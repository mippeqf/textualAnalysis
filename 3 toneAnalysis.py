# PURPOSE
# Simple Application of LM dictionary (bag of words approach)
# Naive Bayes (Antweiler & Frank und Problem 15 of Hillert's course) requires manual classification
# of a training data set, because Bayes needs prior probabilities obvs.
#
# Not sure where Stemming and Lemmtization could be relevant, but I don't see the need for it right now
# Word complexity, sentence length and Jaccard similarity are all aditional tools that can be used, but
# are not necessary for tonal analysis
#
# Use only modern Minutes for now, if there's enough time, see if reliable release schedule of
# Minutes of Actions (67-93) can be obtained.

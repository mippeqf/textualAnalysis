                           Reserve's Balance Sheet</b
                        >
                        <br />The Manager of the System Open Market Account
                        reported on recent developments in domestic and foreign
                        financial markets. The Manager also reported on System
                        open market operations in Treasury securities, agency
                        debt, and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) since
                        the Committee's September 22-23 meeting. By unanimous
                        vote, the Committee ratified those transactions. There
                        were no open market operations in foreign currencies for
                        the System's account during the intermeeting period.
                        Since the Committee met in September, the Federal
                        Reserve's total assets were about unchanged, on balance,
                        at approximately $2.2 trillion, as the increase in the
                        System's holdings of securities roughly matched a
                        further decline in usage of the System's credit and
                        liquidity facilities. The Manager noted that, as of
                        October 30, $300 billion in Treasury securities had been
                        purchased, as directed by the Committee. Overall, the
                        Treasury market had recovered substantially from the
                        strains during the financial crisis, and the Manager
                        reported that the completion of the Federal Reserve's
                        purchase program did not appear to have led to any
                        significant upward pressure on Treasury yields or to any
                        notable deterioration in Treasury market functioning.
                        There was little evidence, to date, of a buildup in
                        year-end funding pressures, although demand for Treasury
                        bills with maturities extending just beyond the year-end
                        seemed to be elevated. The Manager noted that the recent
                        path of purchases of agency debt was consistent with
                        buying a cumulative amount of $175 billion by the end of
                        the first quarter of 2010.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        The staff briefed the Committee on recent developments
                        regarding various Federal Reserve liquidity and credit
                        facilities, including the Term Auction Facility (TAF),
                        the primary credit program, the Term Asset-Backed
                        Securities Loan Facility (TALF), and the swap lines with
                        foreign central banks. Usage of these facilities had
                        been declining in recent months as financial market
                        conditions continued to improve. On September 24, the
                        Board of Governors announced a gradual reduction in
                        amounts to be auctioned under the TAF through January
                        and indicated that auctions of credit with maturities
                        longer than 28 days would be phased out. The staff
                        reviewed the changes that had been made since the onset
                        of the crisis to the terms of the primary credit
                        program, including loan maturities and interest rates.
                        The staff noted that reducing the maximum maturity of
                        loans available under the primary credit program from 90
                        days to 28 days would represent another step toward
                        normalization of the Federal Reserve's
                        policy-implementation framework and would align the
                        maximum maturities of the primary credit program with
                        those under the TAF, but no action on this matter was
                        taken by the Board at this meeting. Regarding the TALF,
                        the staff indicated that auto and credit card
                        asset-backed security issuance was increasingly being
                        funded by non-TALF sources; however, commercial MBS
                        remained more dependent on TALF financing.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        The staff presented another update on the continuing
                        development of several tools that could help support a
                        smooth withdrawal of policy accommodation at the
                        appropriate time. These measures include executing
                        reverse repurchase agreements (RPs) on a large scale,
                        potentially with counterparties other than the primary
                        dealers; implementing a term deposit facility, available
                        to depository institutions, to reduce the supply of
                        reserve balances; and taking steps to tighten the link
                        between the interest rate paid on reserve balances held
                        at the Federal Reserve Banks and the federal funds rate.
                        The staff had made considerable further progress on
                        these tools. Participants expressed confidence that the
                        Committee would be in a position to remove policy
                        accommodation when appropriate by raising the rate of
                        interest paid on excess reserves and by employing
                        reserve-management tools such as reverse RPs, term
                        deposits, and, if desirable, asset sales. Completing the
                        operational work necessary to establish reverse RPs and
                        term deposits as tools that can drain large volumes of
                        reserves was viewed as an important near-term objective.
                        Participants anticipated that the Federal Reserve would
                        conduct tests of these tools, but they stressed that
                        such testing would not imply that these tools would be
                        employed for policy purposes any time soon.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Participants expressed a range of views about how the
                        Committee might use its various tools in combination to
                        foster most effectively its dual objectives of maximum
                        employment and price stability. As part of the
                        Committee's strategy for eventual exit from the period
                        of extraordinary policy accommodation, several
                        participants thought that asset sales could be a useful
                        tool to reduce the size of the Federal Reserve's balance
                        sheet and lower the level of reserve balances, either
                        prior to or concurrently with increasing the policy
                        rate. In their view, such sales would help reinforce the
                        effectiveness of paying interest on excess reserves as
                        an instrument for firming policy at the appropriate time
                        and would help quicken the restoration of a balance
                        sheet composition in which Treasury securities were the
                        predominant asset. Other participants had reservations
                        about asset sales--especially in advance of a decision
                        to raise policy interest rates--and noted that such
                        sales might elicit sharp increases in longer-term
                        interest rates that could undermine attainment of the
                        Committee's goals. Furthermore, they believed that other
                        reserve management tools such as reverse RPs and term
                        deposits would likely be sufficient to implement an
                        appropriate exit strategy and that assets could be
                        allowed to run off over time, reflecting prepayments and
                        the maturation of issues. Participants agreed to
                        continue to evaluate various potential
                        policy-implementation tools and the possible
                        combinations and sequences in which they might be used.
                        They also agreed that it would be important to develop
                        communication approaches for clearly explaining to the
                        public the use of these tools and the Committee's exit
                        strategy more broadly.

                        <b>Staff Review of the Economic Situation</b>
                        <br />The information reviewed at the November 3-4
                        meeting suggested that overall economic activity
                        continued to rise in recent months. Manufacturers
                        increased production in September for the third
                        consecutive month. The gradual recovery in construction
                        of single-family homes from its extremely low level
                        earlier in the year continued, and home sales increased
                        in the third quarter. Although consumer spending on
                        motor vehicles declined in September after the
                        expiration of government rebates, other household
                        spending rose. Outlays for equipment and software
                        (E&amp;S) appeared to be stabilizing. However, the labor
                        market weakened further, and business spending on
                        nonresidential structures continued to decline.
                        Meanwhile, consumer price inflation remained subdued in
                        recent months.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        The labor market continued to weaken in September, but
                        the pace of deterioration lessened from that seen
                        earlier in the year. Job losses remained widespread
                        across industries. The length of the average workweek
                        for production and nonsupervisory workers decreased, and
                        the index of aggregate hours worked for this group fell,
                        albeit more slowly than earlier in the year. In the
                        household survey, the unemployment rate rose in
                        September to 9.8 percent, and the labor force
                        participation rate fell to its lowest level of the year.
                        Continuing claims for unemployment insurance through
                        regular state programs declined through early October,
                        but total claims, including those for extended and
                        emergency benefits, remained high.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Industrial production rose in September for the third
                        consecutive month. A substantial portion of the
                        third-quarter gain was directly attributable to a
                        rebound in motor vehicle assemblies and related parts
                        production, but increases in production were widespread
                        across the industrial sector. Indicators from business
                        surveys suggested that there would be further gains in
                        factory output over the near term. Nevertheless,
                        considerable slack remained in the manufacturing sector,
                        as the factory utilization rate for September was up
                        only a bit from its historical low earlier this year.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        For the third quarter as a whole, real personal
                        consumption expenditures (PCE) rose at a solid rate,
                        with noticeable increases in motor vehicles, furniture,
                        electronics, and other durable goods. However, real
                        outlays declined in September after a sharp increase in
                        August. The monthly pattern in expenditures was
                        significantly affected by swings in motor vehicle sales
                        during and after the government's "cash-for-clunkers"
                        program. Real disposable personal income fell for the
                        fourth consecutive month in September, reflecting the
                        weakness in the labor market. Poor labor market
                        conditions and prior declines in household net worth
                        appeared to have weighed on consumer sentiment, and the
                        October Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank
                        Lending Practices (SLOOS) suggested that many banking
                        institutions continued to tighten standards for consumer
                        lending in the third quarter.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        The housing sector continued to recover, on balance.
                        Although single-family starts were about flat in
                        September, the number of starts was well above the
                        record low reached in the first quarter of the year. In
                        the much smaller multifamily sector, where tight credit
                        conditions persisted and vacancies remained elevated,
                        starts were about unchanged. Sales of new homes,
                        although down a bit in September, rose over the third
                        quarter as a whole. The inventory of unsold new homes
                        declined further, as sales outpaced construction. Sales
                        of existing single-family homes increased in September
                        and for the quarter as a whole, and recent resale
                        activity appeared to be driven primarily by transactions
                        of nondistressed properties. The average interest rate
                        on 30-year conforming fixed-rate mortgages remained very
                        low over the intermeeting period. Although some house
                        price indexes had risen in recent months, such indexes
                        remained below year-earlier levels.

                        Real spending on E&amp;S appeared to have stabilized in
                        the third quarter. Real business outlays on high-tech
                        E&amp;S increased modestly further, outlays for aircraft
                        posted another gain, and business investment in motor
                        vehicles and other areas was down only slightly. The
                        improvements in a number of the fundamental determinants
                        of investment in E&amp;S, including a decline in the
                        cost of capital and a rise in business output, suggested
                        further, albeit sluggish, gains in spending over the
                        next few quarters. The responses to the October SLOOS
                        indicated that banks continued to tighten standards on
                        commercial and industrial (C&amp;I) loans to firms.
                        Meanwhile, conditions in the nonresidential construction
                        sector generally remained quite poor. The recent trend
                        in architectural billings was consistent with further
                        declines in nonresidential construction, and employment
                        in the sector continued to decline. The October SLOOS
                        suggested that financing for new construction projects
                        was very difficult for businesses to obtain. The Bureau
                        of Economic Analysis estimated that businesses continued
                        to liquidate inventories in the third quarter, but at a
                        slower rate than in the preceding quarter.

                        In August, the U.S. international trade deficit
                        narrowed, as exports edged up and imports declined, but
                        it remained wider than it had been at its recent low
                        point in May. The increase in exports of goods and
                        services was held down by a sharp drop in the volatile
                        aircraft category. The decline in imports of goods and
                        services was led by a lower volume of imported oil. In
                        contrast, imports of machinery, automotive products, and
                        industrial supplies increased.

                        Indicators of economic activity in the advanced foreign
                        economies during the third quarter were mixed, but
                        consistent with economic recovery in the aggregate. In
                        most countries, purchasing managers surveys were at
                        levels consistent with expansion, and many indicators of
                        consumer and business confidence continued to show
                        improvement. Economic indicators were strongest in Japan
                        and the euro area, where industrial production rebounded
                        sharply. In contrast, real gross domestic product (GDP)
                        contracted in the United Kingdom in the third quarter,
                        and real GDP in Canada edged down in July and August. In
                        most emerging market economies, recent data showed that
                        economic recovery continued in the third quarter. Real
                        GDP increased strongly in China, Korea, and Singapore,
                        and the recovery in Brazil continued. In Mexico,
                        available data suggested that activity had begun to
                        expand after several quarters of contraction. Across
                        most of the major foreign economies, price pressures
                        remained subdued. Twelve-month inflation remained
                        elevated but declined further in Mexico and Brazil.

                        In the United States, recent monthly data indicated that
                        consumer price inflation remained subdued. The PCE price
                        index moved up only a bit in September as increases in
                        energy prices were largely offset by declines in food
                        prices. Core PCE prices also edged up during the month.
                        Gasoline prices rose again in October. Median year-ahead

                        increased, remaining higher than at the turn of the
                        year, but longer-term inflation expectations from this
                        survey were about unchanged. Measures of labor
                        compensation rose moderately in the third quarter after
                        decelerating significantly in the first half of the
                        year. The employment cost index for wages and salaries
                        was boosted by increases in several industry categories
                        that might have been affected by the rise in the minimum
                        wage in July. Output per hour rose sharply in the second
                        and third quarters, contributing to a sizable decline in
                        unit labor costs so far this year.

                        <b>Staff Review of the Financial Situation</b>
                        <br />Market participants largely anticipated the
                        decisions by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) at
                        the September meeting to leave the target range for the
                        federal funds rate unchanged and to extend the Federal
                        Reserve's purchases of agency MBS and agency debt
                        through the end of the first quarter of 2010 to allow
                        for a gradual reduction in the pace of these purchases.
                        The announcement of the Committee's intent to purchase
                        the full $1.25 trillion of agency MBS securities reduced
                        some uncertainty about the cumulative amount of these
                        purchases. After the release of the statement, investors
                        marked down their expected path for the federal funds
                        rate slightly; over subsequent weeks, that initial
                        reaction was largely reversed so that, on balance, the
                        expected path appeared to change little over the
                        intermeeting period. Yields on nominal Treasury
                        securities were about unchanged on net. Inflation
                        compensation based on five-year Treasury
                        inflation-protected securities (TIPS) rose over the
                        intermeeting period, apparently owing in part to an
                        increase in oil and other commodity prices, while
                        five-year inflation compensation five years ahead was
                        little changed.

                        Overall conditions in short-term funding markets eased a
                        bit further during the intermeeting period. Spreads
                        between London interbank offered rates (Libor) and
                        overnight index swap (OIS) rates at the one- and
                        three-month maturities were about unchanged and were
                        near their pre-crisis levels. Spreads at the six-month
                        maturity narrowed but remained elevated. Spreads on
                        A2/P2-rated commercial paper (CP) and AA-rated
                        asset-backed CP remained at the lower ends of their
                        respective ranges over the past two years. Indicators of
                        Treasury market functioning, including on-the-run
                        liquidity premiums for the 10-year Treasury note and
                        trading volumes in both the nominal and TIPS markets,
                        showed some signs of improvement over the intermeeting
                        period, but trading conditions remained somewhat
                        impaired. Year-end pressures in funding markets
                        generally appeared modest. However, some evidence
                        pointed to increased demand for Treasury securities that
                        mature soon after the turn of the year.

                        Broad stock price indexes were about unchanged, on net,
                        over the intermeeting period despite initial
                        third-quarter earnings reports that mostly beat
                        analysts' forecasts. Option-implied volatility on the
                        S&amp;P 500 index moved up slightly. The spread between
                        an estimate of the expected real return on equity over
                        the next 10 years for S&amp;P 500 firms and an estimate
                        of the real 10-year Treasury yield--a rough gauge of the
                        equity risk premium--remained elevated. Corporate bond
                        spreads narrowed further as yields on investment- and
                        speculative-grade corporate bonds decreased more than
                        those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities.

                        Investor sentiment toward the banking sector appeared to

                        prices fell, with equity prices for large banks
                        declining more than those for regional and smaller
                        banks. Credit default swap spreads for large bank
                        holding companies were about flat, but they widened for
                        regional and smaller banking organizations. Market
                        participants reportedly remained concerned about the
                        earnings prospects for banks in an environment of weak
                        economic activity and rising loan losses.

                        Debt of the private domestic nonfinancial sector
                        appeared to have declined again in the third quarter, as
                        estimates suggested that household debt edged down and
                        nonfinancial business debt decreased. Consumer credit
                        contracted for the seventh consecutive month in August,
                        reflecting declines in both revolving and nonrevolving
                        credit; issuance of consumer credit asset-backed
                        securities also fell. Gross issuance of bonds by
                        investment-grade nonfinancial corporations slowed
                        somewhat in October, even as speculative-grade firms
                        continued to issue bonds at a robust pace. CP
                        outstanding increased, though gains were concentrated at
                        a few large issuers. Bank loans continued to contract
                        rapidly. In contrast, the federal government continued
                        to issue debt at a brisk pace, and gross issuance of
                        state and local government debt remained strong in
                        October.

                        Bank credit declined in September and in the first half
                        of October, as the contraction in C&amp;I loans
                        contributed importantly to a further decline in total
                        loans over the period. According to the SLOOS, bank
                        lending standards and terms tightened further and demand
                        continued to decline, on net, for most types of loans in
                        the third quarter. Commercial real estate (CRE) loans
                        also continued to decrease, reportedly because of
                        widespread paydowns and charge-offs. In addition,
                        residential mortgage loans on banks' books fell, and
                        revolving home equity loans and consumer loans also
                        contracted. The pace of decline in total loans at large
                        banks continued to exceed that at smaller banks. The
                        allowance for loan and lease losses rose further at
                        large banks in September, but it was about unchanged at
                        small banks.

                        M2 appeared to have expanded at a moderate rate in

                        rapidly, small time deposits and retail money market
                        mutual funds continued to contract. Meanwhile, currency

                        Stock indexes fell over the intermeeting period in most

                        Japan and Canada. Equity prices were mixed in emerging

                        central banks left their respective policy rates
                        unchanged over the intermeeting period. The European
                        Central Bank, the Bank of England, and the Bank of Japan
                        continued implementing their special liquidity and asset
                        purchase programs, although Bank of Japan officials
                        indicated they would let some credit-easing programs

                        growth over the second half of 2009 but left the
                        forecast for output growth in 2010 and 2011 roughly
                        unchanged. The spending and production data received
                        during the intermeeting period suggested that economic
                        activity, especially household spending, was a little
                        stronger in the summer than previously estimated. Also,
                        industrial production increased more than had been
                        anticipated at the September meeting. But with labor
                        market conditions somewhat weaker than anticipated,
                        earlier declines in wealth still weighing on household
                        balance sheets, and measures of consumer sentiment
                        relatively low, the staff did not take much signal from
                        the recent unexpected strength in spending and output.
                        Indeed, the staff boosted its projection for the
                        unemployment rate over the next several years. Still,
                        the staff continued to believe that several factors that
                        were restraining spending would gradually fade. The
                        staff anticipated that the strengthening of the recovery
                        in real output during 2010 and 2011 would be supported
                        by an ongoing improvement in financial conditions and
                        household balance sheets, continued recovery in the
                        housing sector, improved household and business
                        confidence, and accommodative monetary policy even as
                        the impetus to real activity from fiscal policy
                        diminished.

                        The staff forecast for inflation was little changed from
                        the September meeting. Although oil prices moved higher,
                        likely boosting near-term inflation, the staff also
                        revised up its estimate of the degree of slack in the
                        economy, leaving the forecast for total and core PCE
                        inflation over the next two years little changed. With
                        significant underutilization of resources expected to
                        persist for several years, the staff continued to
                        project that core inflation would slow somewhat further
                        over the next two years.

                        <br />In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, all meeting
                        participants--the five members of the Board of Governors
                        and the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve
                        Banks--provided projections for economic growth, the
                        unemployment rate, and consumer price inflation for each
                        year from 2009 through 2012 and over a longer horizon.

                        expected to converge over time under appropriate
                        monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks.
                        Participants' forecasts through 2012 and over the longer

                        In the meeting participants' discussion of the economic
                        situation and outlook, they agreed that the incoming
                        data and information received from business contacts
                        suggested that economic activity was picking up as
                        anticipated, with output continuing to expand in the
                        fourth quarter. A number of factors were expected to
                        support near-term growth: Business inventories were
                        being brought into better alignment with sales, and the
                        pace of inventory runoff was slowing; activity in the
                        housing sector appeared to be turning up, and house
                        prices seemed to be leveling out or beginning to rise by
                        some measures; consumer spending appeared to be rising
                        even apart from the effects of fiscal incentives to
                        purchase autos; the outlook for growth abroad had
                        improved since earlier in the year, auguring well for
                        U.S. exports; and U.S. and global financial market
                        conditions, while roughly unchanged over the
                        intermeeting period, were substantially better than
                        earlier in the year. Above-trend output growth in the
                        third quarter was a welcome development. Moreover, the
                        upturn in real GDP appeared to reflect stronger final
                        demand and not just a slower pace of inventory
                        decumulation. While these developments were positive,
                        participants noted that it was not clear how much of the
                        recent firming in final demand reflected the effects of
                        temporary fiscal programs to support the auto and
                        housing sectors, and some participants expressed
                        concerns about the ability of the economy to generate a
                        self-sustaining recovery without government support.
                        Nonetheless, participants expected the recovery to
                        continue in subsequent quarters, although at a pace that
                        would be rather slow relative to historical experience,
                        particularly the robust recoveries that followed
                        previous steep downturns. Such a modest pace of
                        expansion would imply only slow improvement in the labor
                        market next year, with unemployment remaining high.
                        Indeed, participants noted that business contacts
                        continued to report plans to be cautious in hiring and
                        capital spending even as demand for their products
                        increased. Nonetheless, economic growth was expected to
                        strengthen during the next two years as housing
                        construction continued to rise and financial conditions
                        improved further, leading to more-substantial increases
                        in resource utilization in product and labor markets.

                        Most participants now viewed the risks to their growth
                        forecasts as being roughly balanced rather than tilted
                        to the downside, but uncertainty surrounding these
                        forecasts was still viewed as quite elevated. Downside
                        risks to growth included the continued weakness in the
                        labor market and its implications for income growth and
                        consumer confidence, as well as the potential for credit
                        availability to remain relatively tight for consumers
                        and some businesses. In this regard, some participants
                        noted the difficulty that smaller, bank-dependent firms
                        were having in securing financing. The CRE sector was
                        also considered a downside risk to the forecast and a
                        possible source of increased pressure on banks. On the
                        other hand, consumer spending on items other than autos
                        had been stronger than expected, which might be
                        signaling more underlying momentum in the recovery and
                        some chance that the step-up in spending would be
                        sustained going forward. In addition, growth abroad had
                        exceeded expectations for some time, potentially
                        providing more support to U.S. exports and domestic
                        growth than anticipated.

                        Financial market developments over recent months were
                        generally regarded as supportive of continued economic
                        recovery, with equity prices considerably higher,
                        private credit spreads substantially lower, and
                        financial markets generally performing significantly
                        better than earlier in the year. Participants noted,
                        however, that bank credit remained tight. With rising
                        levels of nonperforming loans expected to continue to be
                        a source of stress, and with many regional and small
                        banks vulnerable to the deteriorating performance of CRE
                        loans, banks continued to tighten lending standards for
                        C&amp;I loans and consumer loans, although the net
                        percentage of banks reporting further tightening in each
                        category had fallen in recent surveys. Bank loans
                        continued to contract sharply in all categories.
                        Participants noted that the dichotomy between
                        significant easing of conditions in capital markets and
                        continuing tight conditions in the banking sector
                        implied that financing conditions differed for large and
                        small firms. Large firms with access to debt and equity
                        markets for financing had relatively little difficulty
                        in obtaining credit and in many cases also had high
                        levels of retained earnings with which to fund their
                        operations and investment. In contrast, smaller firms,
                        which tend to be more dependent on commercial banks for
                        financing, reportedly faced substantial constraints in
                        their access to credit. Limited credit availability,
                        along with weak aggregate demand, was viewed as likely
                        to restrain hiring at small businesses, which are
                        normally a source of employment growth in recoveries.

                     <p>
                        The weakness in labor market conditions remained an
                        important concern to meeting participants, with
                        unemployment expected to remain elevated for some time.
                        Although the pace of job losses was moderating, the
                        unusually large fraction of those who were working part
                        time for economic reasons and the unusually low level of
                        the average workweek pointed to only a gradual decline
                        in the unemployment rate as the economic recovery
                        proceeded. In addition, business contacts reported that
                        they would be cautious in their hiring and would
                        continue to aggressively seek cost savings in the
                        absence of revenue growth. Indeed, participants expected
                        that businesses would be able to meet any increases in
                        demand in the near term by raising their employees'
                        hours and boosting productivity, thus delaying the need
                        to add to their payrolls; this view was supported by
                        aggregate data indicating rapid productivity growth in
                        recent quarters. Moreover, the need to reallocate labor
                        across sectors as the recovery proceeds, as well as
                        losses of skills caused by high levels of long-term
                        unemployment and permanent separations, could limit the
                        pace of gains in employment. Participants discussed the
                        possibility that this recovery could resemble the past
                        two, which were characterized by a slow pace of hiring
                        for a time even after aggregate demand picked up.

                        The prospect for continued weakness in labor markets
                        remained an important factor in the outlook for consumer
                        spending. Although consumer spending had picked up more
                        than expected in recent months, participants saw that
                        increase as partly reflecting special factors such as
                        the cash-for-clunkers program. Uncertain job prospects,
                        slow income growth, and tight credit, as well as wealth
                        levels that remained relatively low despite the recent
                        rise in equity prices and stabilization in house prices,
                        were seen as weighing on consumer confidence and the
                        growth of consumer spending for some time to come. In
                        such an environment, households' saving behavior was an
                        important source of uncertainty in the outlook.
                        Participants continued to believe that the most likely
                        outcome was for the saving rate to remain near its
                        average level over the past few quarters or to edge up
                        gradually. However, they could not completely discount
                        the possibility of a further substantial rise in the
                        saving rate as households took further steps to repair
                        their balance sheets.

                     <p>
                        Participants noted that firms seemed to be reducing
                        inventories at a slower pace than earlier in the year
                        and apparently had made substantial progress in reducing
                        stocks toward desired levels. With inventories lower,
                        firms were beginning to raise production to meet at
                        least a portion of increased demand, and this adjustment
                        was expected to make an important contribution to
                        economic recovery in the fourth quarter of the year and,
                        to a lesser extent, in 2010 as well. Investment in
                        E&amp;S appeared to have stabilized in the third
                        quarter, and recent data on new orders continued to
                        point to a pickup next year. However, many participants
                        expressed the view that cautious business sentiment,
                        together with low industrial utilization rates, was
                        likely to keep new capital spending subdued until firms
                        became more confident about the durability of increases
                        in demand.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        In the residential real estate sector, home sales and
                        construction increased over recent months from very low
                        levels; moreover, house prices appeared to be
                        stabilizing and in some areas had reportedly moved
                        higher. Generally, the outlook was for these trends to
                        continue. However, some participants still viewed the
                        improvements as quite tentative, pointing to potential
                        sources of softness from the pending termination of the
                        temporary tax credit for first-time homebuyers, the
                        winding down of the Federal Reserve's agency MBS
                        purchase program, and the downward pressure that
                        anticipated further increases in foreclosures would put
                        on house prices. In contrast to developments in the
                        residential sector, CRE activity continued to fall
                        markedly in most Districts as a result of deteriorating
                        fundamentals, including declining occupancy and rental
                        rates and very tight credit conditions.

                        Stronger foreign economic activity, especially in Asia,
                        as well as the partial reversal this year of the
                        dollar's appreciation during the latter part of 2008,
                        was providing support to U.S. exports. Participants
                        noted that the recent fall in the foreign exchange value
                        of the dollar had been orderly and appeared to reflect
                        an unwinding of safe-haven demand in light of the
                        recovery in financial market conditions this year, but
                        that any tendency for dollar depreciation to intensify
                        or to put significant upward pressure on inflation would
                        bear close watching. Further improvements in foreign
                        economies would likely buoy U.S. exports going forward,
                        but as the recovery took hold in the United States,
                        import growth would also strengthen.

                     <p>
                        Participants continued to discuss the appropriate
                        weights to place on resource slack, inflation
                        expectations, and other factors in assessing the
                        inflation outlook. In the near term, most participants
                        anticipated that substantial slack in both labor and
                        product markets would likely keep inflation subdued.
                        Indeed, the considerable decelerations in wages and unit
                        labor costs this year were cited as factors putting
                        downward pressure on inflation. However, some
                        participants noted that the recent rise in the prices of
                        oil and other commodities, as well as increases in
                        import prices stemming from the decline in the foreign
                        exchange value of the dollar, could boost inflation
                        pressures. Overall, many participants viewed the risks
                        to their inflation outlooks over the next few quarters
                        as being roughly balanced. Some saw the risks as tilted
                        to the downside in the near term, reflecting the quite
                        elevated level of economic slack and the possibility
                        that inflation expectations could begin to decline in
                        response to the low level of actual inflation. But
                        others felt that risks were tilted to the upside over a
                        longer horizon, because of the possibility that
                        inflation expectations could rise as a result of the
                        public's concerns about extraordinary monetary policy
                        stimulus and large federal budget deficits. Moreover,
                        these participants noted that banks might seek to reduce
                        appreciably their excess reserves as the economy
                        improves by purchasing securities or by easing credit
                        standards and expanding their lending substantially.
                        Such a development, if not offset by Federal Reserve
                        actions, could give additional impetus to spending and,
                        potentially, to actual and expected inflation. To keep
                        inflation expectations anchored, all participants agreed
                        that it was important for policy to be responsive to
                        changes in the economic outlook and for the Federal
                        Reserve to continue to clearly communicate its ability
                        and intent to begin withdrawing monetary policy
                        accommodation at the appropriate time and pace.

                        <b>Committee Policy Action</b>
                        <br />In the members' discussion of monetary policy for
                        the period ahead, they agreed that no substantive
                        changes to the Committee's federal funds target range or
                        large-scale asset purchase programs were warranted at
                        this meeting. On balance, the economic outlook had
                        changed little since the September meeting. The recovery
                        appeared to be continuing and was expected to gradually
                        strengthen over time. Still, most members projected that
                        over the next couple of years, the unemployment rate
                        would remain quite elevated and the level of inflation
                        would remain below rates consistent over the longer run
                        with the Federal Reserve's objectives. Based on this
                        outlook, members decided to maintain the federal funds
                        target range at 0 to 1/4 percent and to continue to
                        state their expectation that economic conditions were
                        likely to warrant exceptionally low rates for an
                        extended period. Low levels of resource utilization,
                        subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation
                        expectations were among the important factors underlying
                        their expectation for monetary policy, and members
                        agreed that policy communications would be enhanced by
                        citing these conditions in the policy statement. Members
                        noted the possibility that some negative side effects
                        might result from the maintenance of very low short-term
                        interest rates for an extended period, including the
                        possibility that such a policy stance could lead to
                        excessive risk-taking in financial markets or an
                        unanchoring of inflation expectations. While members
                        currently saw the likelihood of such effects as
                        relatively low, they would remain alert to these risks.
                        All agreed that the path of short-term rates going
                        forward would be dependent on the evolution of the
                        economic outlook.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        With respect to the large-scale asset purchase programs,
                        all members supported reiterating the Committee's
                        intention to purchase $1.25 trillion of agency MBS by
                        the end of the first quarter of 2010. The Committee also
                        agreed to specify that its agency debt purchases would
                        cumulate to about $175 billion by the end of the first
                        quarter, $25 billion less than the previously announced
                        maximum for these purchases. Owing to the limited
                        availability of agency debt and concerns that larger
                        purchases could impair market functioning, the
                        Committee's transactions in these instruments for some
                        time had been on a trajectory that would leave total
                        purchases somewhat below the previously established
                        maximum. Announcing that purchases would total about
                        $175 billion was viewed as providing greater clarity to
                        the public regarding the expected amount of purchases
                        and would not reflect a decision to scale back the
                        degree of policy accommodation. Members also decided to
                        reiterate their intention to gradually slow the pace of
                        the Committee's agency MBS and agency debt purchases to
                        promote a smooth transition in markets as the announced
                        purchases are completed. The Committee agreed that it
                        would continue to evaluate the timing and overall
                        amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the
                        evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial
                        markets.

                     <p>
                        At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted
                        to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New
                        York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute
                        transactions in the System Account in accordance with
                        the following domestic policy directive:

                        <p>
                           "The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and
                           financial conditions that will foster price stability
                           and promote sustainable growth in output. To further
                           its long-run objectives, the Committee seeks
                           conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal
                           funds trading in a range from 0 to 1/4 percent. The
                           Committee directs the Desk to purchase agency debt
                           and agency MBS during the intermeeting period with
                           the aim of providing support to private credit
                           markets and economic activity. The timing and pace of
                           these purchases should depend on conditions in the
                           markets for such securities and on a broader
                           assessment of private credit market conditions. The
                           Desk is expected to execute purchases of about $175
                           billion in housing-related agency debt and about
                           $1.25 trillion of agency MBS by the end of the first
                           quarter of 2010. The Desk is expected to gradually
                           slow the pace of these purchases as they near
                           completion. The Committee anticipates that outright
                           purchases of securities will cause the size of the
                           Federal Reserve's balance sheet to expand
                           significantly in coming months. The System Open
                           Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep
                           the Committee informed of ongoing developments
                           regarding the System's balance sheet that could
                           affect the attainment over time of the Committee's
                           objectives of maximum employment and price
                           stability."

                        <p>
                           "Information received since the Federal Open Market
                           Committee met in September suggests that economic
                           activity has continued to pick up. Conditions in
                           financial markets were roughly unchanged, on balance,
                           over the intermeeting period. Activity in the housing
                           sector has increased over recent months. Household
                           spending appears to be expanding but remains
                           constrained by ongoing job losses, sluggish income
                           growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit.
                           Businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment
                           and staffing, though at a slower pace; they continue
                           to make progress in bringing inventory stocks into
                           better alignment with sales. Although economic
                           activity is likely to remain weak for a time, the
                           Committee anticipates that policy actions to
                           stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal
                           and monetary stimulus, and market forces will support
                           a strengthening of economic growth and a gradual
                           return to higher levels of resource utilization in a
                           context of price stability.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           With substantial resource slack likely to continue to
                           dampen cost pressures and with longer-term inflation
                           expectations stable, the Committee expects that
                           inflation will remain subdued for some time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve will
                           continue to employ a wide range of tools to promote
                           economic recovery and to preserve price stability.
                           The Committee will maintain the target range for the
                           federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues
                           to anticipate that economic conditions, including low
                           rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation
                           trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely
                           to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal
                           funds rate for an extended period. To provide support
                           to mortgage lending and housing markets and to
                           improve overall conditions in private credit markets,
                           the Federal Reserve will purchase a total of $1.25
                           trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and
                           about $175 billion of agency debt. The amount of
                           agency debt purchases, while somewhat less than the
                           previously announced maximum of $200 billion, is
                           consistent with the recent path of purchases and
                           reflects the limited availability of agency debt. In
                           order to promote a smooth transition in markets, the
                           Committee will gradually slow the pace of its
                           purchases of both agency debt and agency
                           mortgage-backed securities and anticipates that these
                           transactions will be executed by the end of the first
                           quarter of 2010. The Committee will continue to
                           evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its
                           purchases of securities in light of the evolving
                           economic outlook and conditions in financial markets.
                           The Federal Reserve is monitoring the size and
                           composition of its balance sheet and will make
                           adjustments to its credit and liquidity programs as
                           warranted."
